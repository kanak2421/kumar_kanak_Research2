Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## API installation 
# Installing Lumen
Lumen utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies. So, before using Lumen, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

Install Lumen by issuing the Composer create-project command in your terminal:

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/lumen blog
Serving Your Application
To serve your project locally, you may use the Laravel Homestead virtual machine, Laravel Valet, or the built-in PHP development server:

php -S localhost:8000 -t public

# Configuration
All of the configuration options for the Lumen framework are stored in the .env file. Once Lumen is installed, you should also configure your local environment.

# Application Key
The next thing you should do after installing Lumen is set your application key to a random string. Typically, this string should be 32 characters long. The key can be set in the .env environment file. If you have not renamed the .env.example file to .env, you should do that now. If the application key is not set, your user encrypted data will not be secure!


# Compatibility
Since Lumen is a totally separate framework from Laravel, it does not intentionally offer compatibility with any additional Laravel libraries like Cashier, Passport, Scout, etc. If your application requires the functionality provided by these libraries, please use the Laravel framework.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).
